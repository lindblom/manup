# This is old code
This is a old rails project i made.
It was supposed to be a compilation of self help material for men :P

## Features
If I remember correctly it has an easy way to add new articles (markdown) and resources (links to books and podcasts). It it shows up on the correct pages.


## Why is it on github
I didnt want to keep it on my computer so I put it here :)
Maybe you can use it for something, but probably not.
